Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence 2 (PCEEC2)
========================================================

The pceec2 repository contains

- a revised and corrected version of the parsed files in the PCEEC

  The original 2006 version
  (<https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2510>)
  was deposited with the Oxford Text Archive (OTA).  The OTA has not
  responded to repeated requests to deposit the corrected version with
  them.  The main author of the original version, Terttu Nevalainen, and
  the main author of the parsed version, Ann Taylor, have given
  permission to distribute the corrected version on github.

- a lemmatized version of those files based on the "New English
  Dictionary based on historical principles"
  (<https://archive.org/details/oed01arch/page/522/mode/2up>).  See the
  annotation guidelines for details
