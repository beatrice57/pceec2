<h2>The Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence 2</h2>

<h3>The associated information file (AIF)</h3>

In addition to being included in the corpus files (in the form
of <a href="metadata.html">metadata</a>), information for each letter
is provided in the 'associated information file' (AIF). This is an
excel file, <tt>aif-2002.xlsx</tt>, located in the <b>corpus</b>
directory.  The AIF also includes <a href="#api">'additional personal
information'</a> (API) not included in the corpus files.

<p>
The 2022 version of the AIF spreadsheet contains corrections to the
2006 version.  Corrections to METADATA nodes of the corpus files are
highlighted in green.  Cases where the spreadsheet failed to reflect
correct information in the METADATA nodes are highlighted in blue.

<p>
For convenience in importing the data into statistical software, the
spreadsheet is also available as a .csv file (here, the highlighting
just described is missing).

<p>
The 2022 version of the AIF contains the same fields as the original
version along with two additional fields in columns L and M.  A header
row with the field names has been added at the top of the file.

<h3>Additional personal information (API)</h3>

The API includes titles (e.g. COUNTESS_OF_ARUNDEL,
5TH_EARL_OF_NORTHUMBERLAND, SIR, BARON, BISHOP, etc.), as well as any
other available information about the person including professional
roles and indications of status (e.g., LORD_KEEPER, LOCAL_POLITICIAN,
ROYAL_MINISTER, LAWYER, GENTLEMAN, YEOMAN, SERVANT, RENT_COLLECTOR,
etc.). The title, if any, is always given first, followed by any other
information separated by a slash. (e.g.,
1ST_LORD_BURGHLEY/ROYAL_MINISTER(DNB) Information followed by (DNB)
indicates that the API is taken from
the <a href="http://www.oxforddnb.com" target="_new">online
Dictionary of National Biography</a>. Information not from the DNB was
either provided by the CEEC team or sourced from the editions, or the
letters themselves.

<td valign=center> The API is provided as an aid to users, but it is
known to be incomplete, and although we have made considerable efforts
to standardize it, inconsistencies remain. Users interested in roles
or status should take the API as a starting point for their own further
research.

<h3>Change from 2006?</h3>

This column contains one of three values.  "ok" indicates that the
information in the 2006 release was correct.  "corrected" indicates
that one or more fields was corrected in the files for the 2022
version.  "corrected in spreadsheet" indicates that one or more fields
was corrected in the spreadsheet to be consistent with the files.  In
the excel version of the spreadsheet, these changes are highlighted in
green and blue, respectively.

<h3>Order in Gardiner letters</h3>

Ordinarily, the letters appear in the files in the order corresponding
to the letter reference ID.  For some reason, this is not the case for
the Gardiner letters.  In the spreadsheet, these are ordered by letter
reference ID.  For convenience, this column indicates the order in
which the letters appear in the file.
