In addition to the parse, each token in the PCEEC2 contains searchable
sociolinguistic information. This information is collectively referred
to as 'metadata' and is dominated by a token-initial node labelled
METADATA.

    information compiled by Helsinki and included at the head of each

    parameters</a>.  The Helsinki information is sometimes incorrect,
    and in such cases, corrections have been made to the associated

    to difficulties, however, since users will generally only search
    the METADATA nodes.

<h3>Contents of the metadata node</h3>

The METADATA node contains three nodes: AUTHOR, RECIPIENT, and
LETTER. Each of these nodes contains relevant information separated
into fields by colons.

<a name="author_recipient">
<h3>Author and recipient information</h3>

The following information is given for the author and recipient: 

<blockquote>

<a name="name">
<h4>Name (AUTHOR/RECIPIENT field 1)</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="#women">Women</a>
<li><a href="#royalty">Royalty</a>
<li><a href="#unknown">Unknown recipient/name unknown</a>
</ul>

Each author/recipient in the corpus is given a unique
name. Father/son, mother/daughter pairs are generally distinguished by
SR/JR (e.g. EDWARD_CONWAY_SR, EDWARD_CONWAY_JR). More than two members
of the same (extended) family with the same name are distinguished by
Roman numerals I, II, III, etc. (e.g., WILLIAM_PASTON_I,
WILLIAM_PASTON_II, WILLIAM_PASTON_III, WILLIAM_PASTON_IV, etc.). Roman
numerals always start at I, except in the case of kings, who are
indicated in the usual way (e.g. HENRY_TUDOR_VIII). Women with the
same name are distinguished by their maiden name rather than by SR/JR
or numbers.  In other words, ANNE_BACON is a different individual from
ANNE_BACON[N.COOKE] and ANNE_BACON[N.GRESHAM]. Unrelated writers with
the same name are distinguished by Arabic numbers (JOHN_WILLIAMS_1,
JOHN_WILLIAMS_2).

<p>
For most correspondents, both a first and last name are known, but
occasionally only one name is known. When only the last name is known,
a title is included when supplied (e.g., MRS_NECTON, COLONEL_STRODE).
If no title is supplied, the person is referred to by the single name
only (e.g., WADEHILL).  Individuals known only by first name are
generally (early or foreign) royalty, or certain religious figures
(abbots, in particular).  These are given either a number (EDWARD_IV),
a title (PRINCE MAURICE), or an epithet (JOHN_OF_NORTON,
JOHN_OF_TEWKESBURY, JOHN_OF_LANCASTER). The latter distinguishes three
John's: the abbot of Norton, the abbot of Tewkesbury, and the duke of
Bedford.

<a name="women">
<h4>Women</h4>

Women are generally referred to by the name they were using at the
time of writing. If they are married and their maiden name is known,
it is included in square brackets prefaced by N. for <i>n√©e</i>
(e.g. MARY_PEYTON[N.ASTON]). In general, the inclusion of a maiden
name indicates a married state at the time of writing, but its absence
carries no information, since not all maiden names are known.

<p>
Women who wrote letters under more than one name are given both names
separated by a slash (DOROTHY_OSBORNE/TEMPLE). In some cases, the two
names are the woman's maiden and married name
(DOROTHY_OSBORNE/TEMPLE), but they may also be two married names. In
this case, if the maiden name is known, it is also included, if known
(e.g., ELIZABETH_POYNINGS/BROWNE[N.PASTON]). The difference between
DOROTHY_OSBORNE/TEMPLE and MARY_PEYTON[N.ASTON] is that Dorothy wrote
both as Dorothy Osborne and as Dorothy Temple, whereas Mary wrote only
as Mary Peyton (i.e. when married). Her maiden name is included only
for information purposes. From the information given in the name
(DOROTHY_OSBORNE/TEMPLE) alone, it is not possible to tell whether one
of these names is a maiden name and one a married name or both married
names (although from other information we know that Osborne is her
maiden name and Temple her married name). For
ELIZABETH_POYNINGS/BROWNE[N.PASTON], on the other hand, who wrote both
as Elizabeth Poynings and Elizabeth Browne, we know from the name
alone (because of the inclusion of the maiden name) that both of these
are married names.

<a name="royalty">
<h4>Royalty</h4>

Pre-Tudor kings are referred to by first name and number only
(e.g. RICHARD_III, EDWARD_IV). Other members of the royal family are
referred to by common epithets (RICHARD_OF_YORK,
HUMPHREY_OF_LANCASTER). Tudor and Stuart kings and family are named
Tudor or Stuart along with their number (e.g. HENRY_TUDOR_VIII,
JAMES_STUART_I/VI). Queens are referred to in the same way as other
women, with the exception of Mary Tudor, Queen of England (referred to
as MARY_TUDOR_I), who has the same name as Mary Tudor, Queen of France
(referred to as simply MARY_TUDOR).

<a name="unknown">
<h4>Unknown recipient/name unknown</h4>

In a small number of cases, nothing is known about the recipient of a
letter. In these cases the recipient is listed as
UNKNOWN_RECIPIENT. In line with our policy of uniquely identifying
every individual, each unknown recipient is given a separate arabic
number (e.g., UNKNOWN_RECIPIENT_1, UNKNOWN_RECIPIENT_2, etc.).

<p>
When something about the identity of the recipient is known (usually
by some distinguishing epithet given by the editor, or the content of
the letter) e.g., 'sheriff of Norfolk', but the name is not, the
recipient is listed as NAME_UNKNOWN (or NAMES_UNKNOWN for groups such
as the 'commissioners for recusancy'). As with unknown recipients,
each unnamed individual/group is given a different number. The same
unnamed individual or group as author or recipient of multiple letters
is given the same number.

<p>
The reason for distinguishing these two types
is that for the latter, but not the
former, <a href="aif-2022.html#api">additional personal
information</a> (API) is included in
the <a href="aif-2022.html">associated information file</a>
(AIF). Note that the PRIVY COUNCIL is treated as an individual, i.e.,
a name, and not classified as an unnamed group.

<a name="gender">
<h4>Gender (AUTHOR/RECIPIENT field 2)</h4>

The gender of all correspondents is identified as either MALE or
FEMALE. <a href="#unknown">Unknown recipients</a>, who always occur in
official/professional, rather than personal/family contexts, are
safely assumed to be MALE.

<a name="relationship">
<h4>Relationship (AUTHOR/RECIPIENT field 3)</h4>

This field is an expanded version of the
Helsinki <a href="file_format.html#recipient_type">'recipient type
code'</a> (see also <a href="#recip_type">Recipient classification</a>
below). Specific nuclear family relationships are given in all cases
(DAUGHTER, SON, MOTHER, FATHER, etc.). Specific extended family
relationships (SISTER-IN-LAW, AUNT, etc.) are also given when
known. If the exact relationship is not known (usually because it is
either distant, complicated, or both), the cover term KIN is used. The
final two possible entries for this field are FAMILY_SERVANT, which
simply reproduces the Helsinki 'recipient type' code FS, and FRIEND
(Helsinki code TC). Any relationship that does not fall into one of
the above categories, is left empty (indicated by an underscore in the
field).

<a name="date_of_birth">
<h4>Date of birth (AUTHOR/RECIPIENT field 4)</h4>

A date of birth (DOB) for authors and recipients is given when
known. Dates followed by a question mark (1530?) are uncertain. Some
are baptismal dates. All dates are given in new style (i.e. with the
year beginning in January). All DOBs, whether accompanied by a ? or
not, should be assumed to have a margin of error of a few years on
either side, as sources sometimes differ.

<p>
Author DOBs are largely supplied by Helsinki.  Recipient DOBs not
supplied by the edition or Helsinki come from the online DNB.  For
unknown DOBs, the field is empty (indicated, as usual, by an
underscore).

<a name="age">
<h4>Age at time of writing (AUTHOR/RECIPIENT field 5)</h4>

This number is simply calculated by subtracting
the <a href="#date_of_birth">date of birth</a> (DOB) of the
author/recipient from the <a href="#date">date of the letter</a>. If
either the letter date or the DOB of the correspondent is uncertain
(indicated by a following ?), the age is likewise (e.g., 49?). When
the DOB is unknown or the date of the letter is given as a decade
(e.g., 1500S) or entirely unknown, age is not calculated, and the
field is left empty (indicated, as usual, by an underscore).

<a name="letter">
<h3>Letter information</h3>

The following information is given for the letter:

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding=2>
<tr>
<th width="80px" align=left>Field 1
<td align=left><a href="#reference">unique reference</a>
<tr>
<th align=left>Field 2
<td align=left><a href="#period">time period</a>
<tr>
<th align=left>Field 3
<td align=left><a href="#date">date of letter</a>

<th align=left>Field 4
<td align=left><a href="#authenticity">authenticity</a>
<tr>
<th align=left>Field 5
<td align=left><a href="#recip_type">recipient classification</a>
</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="reference">
<h4>Unique reference (LETTER field 1)</h4>

Each letter in the corpus is uniquely identified by a combination of
the filename and letter number (e.g., ARUNDEL_001).

<br>
<a name="period">
<h4>Time period (LETTER field 2)</h4>

In order to facilitate comparisons of the PCEEC2 with the PPCME2 and
the PPCEME, the time period of the letter is identified according to
the Helsinki Corpus time periods:

<blockquote>
<table  cellpadding=2>
<th width="150px" align=center>Time period
<th align=center>Dates
<tr>
<td align=center>M4 
<td align=left>1420-1500
<tr>
<td align=center>E1 
<td align=left>1500-1569
<tr>
<td align=center>E2 
<td align=left>1570-1639
<tr>
<td align=center>E3
<td align=left>1640-1710
</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="date">
<h4>Date of letter (LETTER field 3)</h4>

This information is taken from the
Helsinki <a href="file_format.html#text_identifier">'text
identifier'</a> parameter (Q).  When the year of the letter is known
it is given precisely. If the date is conjectural it is followed by a
question mark. When a precise year cannot be suggested the decade is
given, indicated by S, as follows: 1500S and 1600S indicate the first
decade of each century, 1510S indicates 1510-1519, etc.  If even the
decade is uncertain, a question mark follows the decade (e.g.,
1530S?).

<br>
<a name="authenticity">
<h4>Authenticity (LETTER field 4)</h4>

Three values are supplied for the authenticity of the letter. This is
a simplified version of the
Helsinki <a href="file_format.html#authenticity">'authenticity
code'</a> found in the <a href="file_format.html#text_identifier">'text
identifier'</a> parameter (Q).

<ul>
<li>AUTOGRAPH
- Includes all letters written by the author (Helsinki 'authenticity
codes' A and B)
<li>COPY
- Includes both copies of letters and letters written for the author
by a secretary (code C)
<li>UNKNOWN
- Authenticity is unknown (code D)
</ul>

<a name="recip_type">
<h4>Recipient classification (LETTER field 5)</h4>

This field contains a more general classification of the information
in field 3 (<a href="#relationship">Relationship</a>) of the
AUTHOR/RECIPIENT nodes. The first two values group family
relationships into nuclear and extended. The last three values simply
replicate the same information as found in the AUTHOR/RECIPIENT node.

<blockquote>
FAMILY_NUCLEAR<br>
FAMILY_OTHER<br>
FAMILY_SERVANT<br>
FRIEND<br>
OTHER
</blockquote>

The information in this field comes from the
Helsinki <a href="file_format.html#recipient_type">'recipient type'</a>
code found in the <a href="file_format.html#text_identifier">'text
identifier'</a>

<a name="metadata_searching">
<h3>Searching the metadata</h3>

The metadata in the format discussed here can only be searched by
CorpusSearch 2 (CS2).  The three nodes included in the METADATA node
(AUTHOR, RECIPIENT, and LETTER) are searched in the same way as 
<a href="../CorpusSearch/documentation/coding.html">CODING</a> strings
are searched. The query below searches column 1 of the CODING string
for the value x.

<blockquote><pre>
query: (CODING column 1 x)  <-- note space between 'column' and '1'
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To search one of the METADATA nodes, simply replace "CODING" with the
name of the node.  The metadata fields continue to be referred to as
columns.

<blockquote><pre>
query: (AUTHOR column 2 MALE)
</pre></blockquote>

The above query finds all the tokens in which the author is male. To
search for other values as well, simply join search functions with
AND.  For instance, the following query finds all men writing to women
in Helsinki period E2.

<blockquote><pre>
query:     (AUTHOR column 2 MALE)
       AND (RECIPIENT column 2 FEMALE)
       AND (LETTER column 2 E2)
</pre></blockquote>

The next query finds all women writing to women.  Note the use
of <a href="../CorpusSearch/documentation/query-language.html#prefix-indices">prefix
indices</a>, which are necessary here, as in any search, in order to
distinguish distinct nodes sharing the same label.

<blockquote><pre>
query: (AUTHOR column 2 [1]FEMALE) AND (RECIPIENT column 2 [2]FEMALE)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To find all women writing to men or men to women, it is safest  to use
<a href="../CorpusSearch/documentation/coding.html">
coding queries</a> inst (rather than the deprecated OR function).

<p>
Metadata can be searched in conjunction with structure.  For instance,
the following query finds all tokens written by women to men, in which
vocatives are used.

<blockquote><pre>
query:     (AUTHOR column 2 FEMALE)
       AND (RECIPIENT column 2 MALE)
       AND (IP* iDoms NP-VOC)
</pre></blockquote>
