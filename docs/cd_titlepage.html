<h2>The Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence 2</h2>


The Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence, second edition
(PCEEC2) is a revised and corrected version of the original 2006
release of the PCEEC, itself based on
the <a href="http://www.eng.helsinki.fi/varieng/team2/1_2_4_projects.htm">Corpus
of Early English Correspondence (CEEC)</a>, compiled at the University
of Helsinki by
the <a href="http://www.eng.helsinki.fi/varieng/main/index-en.htm">Research
Unit for Variation and Change in English</a>. The PCEEC2 contains over
three-quarters of the original CEEC:

<ul>
<li>84 letter collections
<li>approx. 2.2 million words
<li>4,970 letters
</ul>

<p>
<b>Note that there is a
small <a href="overlap-with-ppceme.html">overlap</a> between the
PCEEC2 and the PPCEME.  Users of both corpora should be careful not to
include the same data twice.</b>

<p>
The Corpus of Early English Correspondence (CEEC) was compiled for the
study of social variables in the history of English.  To enable this,
great attention has been paid to the authenticity of letters on the
one hand and to the social representativeness of the writers on the
other. The timespan covered is from c. 1410 to 1695. Because of
widespread illiteracy, however, only the highest ranks of society are
well represented, and women's letters form no more than one fifth of
the full CEEC. For more information on the compilation principles see
Nevalainen & Raumolin-Brunberg (eds.)  (1996) and Ker&#228;nen
(1998).

<p>
The <a href="../annotation-2022/index.html" target="_top">annotation
guidelines</a> for the PCEEC2 are a slightly revised and streamlined
version of those used by the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English
(PPCHE).  The new annotation guidelines will be extended to the PPCHE
in the next release.
