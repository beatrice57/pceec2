<h2>The Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence 2</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

The PCEEC2 is a revised and corrected version of the parsed files in
the PCEEC, differing from the original version released in 2006 as
follows:

<ul>
<li>
The annotation guidelines have been slightly simplified and
streamlined.  The next release of the Penn Parsed Corpora of
Historical English (PPCHE) will be consistent with these new
guidelines, eliminating the slight discrepancies between the PCEEC2
and the PPCHE existing at the moment.
<li>
Annotation errors in the PCEEC have been corrected.  Please report
remaining errors or inconsistencies to Beatrice Santorini (beatrice at
sas dot upenn dot edu).
<li>
Errors in the <a href="corpus_description/aif-2022.html"
target="_new">AIF file</a> and in
the <a href="corpus_description/metadata.html" target="_new">METADATA
nodes</a> have been corrected.  Again, please report remaining errors
to Beatrice Santorini.
</ul>

<p>
As of November 2021, the OTA has suspended new deposits until further
notice.  Therefore, for the moment, the PCEEC2, along with associated
documentation, is being made available
at <a href="https:/github.com/beatrice57/pceec2" target="_new">

<p>
The original PCEEC was part-of-speech tagged by Arja Nurmi (University
of Helsinki) and syntactically annotated by Ann Taylor (University of
York). The sociolinguistic information associated with each letter was
provided by the creators of the Corpus of Early English Correspondence
(CEEC) and by Ann Taylor, assisted by Joanne Close, at York.  The
above-mentioned revisions and corrections were carried out by Beatrice
Santorini at the University of Pennsylvania.

<p>
The CEEC was compiled by the Sociolinguistics and Language History
project team at the Department of English, University of Helsinki.
The team was led by Professor Terttu Nevalainen and included Helena
Raumolin-Brunberg, Jukka Ker&#228;nen, Minna Nevala, Arja Nurmi, and
Minna Palander-Collin.  Help was provided in the compilation of the
corpus by Kirsi Heikkonen and in the proof-reading by Alistair
Melville-Smith, Taru Nurmi, Arja-Liisa Rossi, Reza Sanatnama, Heli
Tissari, and Anne Virolainen.
